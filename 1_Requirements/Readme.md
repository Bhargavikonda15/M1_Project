### Backup, recovery & business continuity
 Banks should ensure adequate back up of data as may be required by their operations. Banks should also have, well documented and tested business continuity plans that address all aspects of the bank’s business 
### Account ID and Password (PIN) Protection 
User Account ID and Password (PIN) protection occurs at the first level within the Internet Banking System. To access Internet Banking, users are required to enter an Account ID and password. Without these, access to the Internet Banking System is denied. Special password characters are used as required :!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|\;:’”, /?
### Failed Log-on Attempts 
As an added security feature, the Internet Banking System is denied access after a pre-determined number of failed log-on attempts. If users have been locked out due to exceeding the pre-determined number of log-on attempts, the users must contact the Bank in order to be reinitialized. 
### Encryption 
In addition to password protection, we ensures server authentication by using the latest techniques of data encryption. Data encryption is a way of translating data into a form that is unintelligible without a deciphering mechanism.
